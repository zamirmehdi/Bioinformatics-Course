## 📝 Assignment Questions

### Question 1: Biological Terminology

**Task:** Provide concise definitions for the following biological terms in your own words (not copy-paste from internet sources).

#### 1.1 Stem Cell (سلول بنیادی)

**Definition Required:**
- What are stem cells?
- What makes them unique?
- What are their key capabilities?

**Key Concepts to Address:**
- Self-renewal ability
- Differentiation potential
- Types of stem cells (pluripotent, multipotent)
- Applications in medicine and research

**Sample Answer Structure:**
```
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells characterized by:
1. Self-renewal: Ability to divide and replicate indefinitely
2. Differentiation: Capacity to develop into specialized cell types
3. Plasticity: Varying degrees of differentiation potential
4. Therapeutic potential: Use in regenerative medicine
```

#### 1.2 Gene Diversity (تنوع ژنتیکی)

**Definition Required:**
- What is genetic diversity?
- How does it differ from genetic variability?
- Why is it important for populations?

**Key Concepts to Address:**
- Total genetic characteristics within a species
- Relationship to adaptation and survival
- Role in evolution and natural selection
- Impact on population resilience

**Important Distinction:**
- **Gene Diversity**: Total collection of genetic traits present
- **Genetic Variability**: Tendency for traits to change/vary

#### 1.3 Gene Expression (بیان ژن)

**Definition Required:**
- What is gene expression?
- What is the process flow?
- How does it relate to phenotype?

**Key Concepts to Address:**
- Central Dogma: DNA → RNA → Protein
- Transcription and translation processes
- Regulation mechanisms (gene activation/silencing)
- Post-translational modifications
- Relationship between genotype and phenotype

**Process Flow:**
```
DNA (Genetic Information)
    ↓ Transcription
mRNA (Messenger RNA)
    ↓ Translation
Protein (Functional Product)
    ↓ Post-translational
Active Protein (Cellular Function)
```

### Question 2: DNA-Cell Relationship

**Conceptual Question:**

> "If we view the cell as a complex computer, what is the role of DNA? Does DNA alone determine all cellular activities? Do cells with identical DNA function identically?"

**Analysis Required:**

#### Part A: DNA's Role in the Cell
- DNA as "storage medium" (like a hard drive or operating system)
- Contains instructions for cellular functions
- Stores hereditary information
- Blueprint for protein synthesis

**Computer Analogy:**
```
Cell ≈ Complex Computer
DNA ≈ Hard Drive / Operating System (contains basic instructions)
Nucleus ≈ CPU (processing center)
Ribosomes ≈ Manufacturing units (protein synthesis)
```

#### Part B: Does DNA Alone Determine Function?

**Critical Thinking Point:**
```
Same DNA ≠ Same Function
```

**Key Concept:** Gene Expression Regulation

**Evidence to Discuss:**
1. **Identical Twins:** Same DNA, different traits over time
2. **Cell Differentiation:** Liver cells vs. neuron cells (same genome, different functions)
3. **Environmental Factors:** Epigenetics, external signals
4. **Gene Regulation:** Not all genes are "turned on" simultaneously

**Example Answer Structure:**
```
No, DNA does not solely determine cellular function because:

1. Differential Gene Expression:
   - Cells selectively activate/deactivate different genes
   - Same genome → Different proteomes
   
2. Epigenetic Regulation:
   - DNA methylation
   - Histone modifications
   - Environmental influences

3. Example:
   - Skin cells and brain cells contain identical DNA
   - But express completely different sets of genes
   - Result: Vastly different structures and functions
```

---

### Question 3: Functional DNA Segments

**Question:**
> "Are all parts of DNA in living organisms functional (useful)?"

**Analysis Required:**

#### Key Concepts to Address:

**1. Coding vs. Non-Coding DNA:**
- **Coding DNA (~2% in humans):** Genes that encode proteins
- **Non-Coding DNA (~98%):** Introns, regulatory regions, "junk DNA"

**2. Functional Categories:**
```
DNA Segments:
├── Protein-Coding Genes (Exons) ✅ Clearly functional
├── Regulatory Elements ✅ Control gene expression
│   ├── Promoters
│   ├── Enhancers
│   └── Silencers
├── Non-Coding RNAs ✅ Functional without coding proteins
│   ├── rRNA (ribosomal)
│   ├── tRNA (transfer)
│   └── miRNA (micro RNA)
├── Introns ⚠️ Removed during RNA processing
├── Repetitive Elements ❓ Function unclear
└── "Junk DNA" ❓ No known function (yet)
```

**3. Current Understanding:**
- Not all DNA segments are actively used
- Some regions may be evolutionary remnants
- "Junk DNA" may have undiscovered functions
- ENCODE project: More functional than previously thought

**Example Answer:**
```
No, not all DNA segments are functional in the traditional sense:

Active Segments:
- Protein-coding genes (~2%)
- Regulatory sequences (promoters, enhancers)
- Non-coding functional RNAs

Inactive/Unclear Segments:
- Intergenic regions
- Transposable elements
- Pseudogenes (non-functional gene copies)
- Heterochromatin (tightly packed, silent)

Note: "Non-functional" doesn't mean "useless" - may have:
- Structural roles (chromosome organization)
- Evolutionary potential (future adaptation)
- Undiscovered regulatory functions
```

### Question 4: Vestigial Traits

**Question:**
> "What are Vestigial Traits? Name several examples in humans."

#### Definition:

**Vestigial Traits (باقیمانده‌های ژنتیکی):**
- Anatomical or behavioral features inherited from evolutionary ancestors
- Once served important functions
- Now reduced, weakened, or non-functional
- Evidence of evolutionary change over time

**Evolutionary Significance:**

- **Modern Function:** Minimal (anchor point for some muscles)

**2. Wisdom Teeth (دندان عقل)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Grinding tough plant materials, roots
- **Current Status:** Often impacted, removed surgically
- **Why Vestigial:** Dietary changes (softer, cooked foods)

**3. Appendix (آپاندیس)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Digesting cellulose in plant-heavy diets
- **Current Status:** Small pouch attached to large intestine
- **Modern Function:** Limited (possible immune system role)
- **Medical Issue:** Appendicitis (inflammation requiring removal)

**4. Body Hair / Goosebumps (سیخ شدن مو)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Insulation, temperature regulation, intimidation
- **Current Status:** Sparse body hair, piloerection reflex
- **Modern Function:** Minimal insulation (we use clothing)

**5. Plica Semilunaris (Third Eyelid / چین هلالی گوشه چشم)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Protective membrane across eye (nictitating membrane)
- **Current Status:** Small fold in eye corner
- **In Other Species:** Still functional in birds, reptiles, some mammals

**6. Palmaris Longus Muscle (عضله کف دست)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Grip strength for tree climbing
- **Current Status:** Absent in ~14% of humans
- **Test:** Touch pinky to thumb - tendon may pop up in wrist

**7. Auricular Muscles (عضلات کنترل گوش)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Moving ears to detect sound direction
- **Current Status:** Weak, vestigial
- **In Other Species:** Dogs, cats move ears freely
- **In Humans:** Some can wiggle ears slightly

**8. Male Nipples (نوک پستان مردان)**
- **Developmental Reason:** Embryos begin gender-neutral
- **No Function:** Males don't produce milk
- **Why Present:** Genetic blueprint shared until sex differentiation

**9. Little Toe (انگشت کوچک پا)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Balance, grip
- **Current Status:** Diminishing utility with modern footwear
- **Trend:** Potentially evolving away

**10. Extrinsic Ear Muscles (عضلات سر)**
- **Ancestral Function:** Complex facial expressions, communication
- **Current Status:** Repurposed for new functions (speech-related)
